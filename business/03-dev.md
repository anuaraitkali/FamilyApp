### 3. Development Phase for FamilyApp

#### 3.1 Backend Development
- **Objective**: Build the backend services to power key features like user management, family groups, financial tracking, and messaging.
- **Tasks**:
  1. **User Management**:
     - Implement authentication (e.g., JWT or OAuth) for family members.
     - Set up user roles (admin, family member) and profile management (e.g., photo upload, contact info).
  2. **Core Business Features**:
     - Develop the financial management system for budgeting and expense tracking.
     - Implement the shared calendar feature for event planning and scheduling.
     - Set up messaging functionality for real-time communication.
  3. **Tech Stack**:
     - **Frameworks**: Use **Django** for backend services (e.g., ASP.NET Core).
     - **APIs**: Implement RESTful APIs or GraphQL for communication between frontend and backend.
     - **Database**: Integrate PostgreSQL for structured data like user info, events, and expenses.
     - **Security**: Implement JWT for secure authentication and ensure data encryption.

#### 3.2 Frontend Development
- **Objective**: Develop a responsive, easy-to-use UI for managing family tasks, finances, and communications.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Build the frontend using **React** for the web application.
  2. Focus on a clean, family-friendly interface that includes a calendar, messaging system, financial tools, and media storage.
  3. **Tech Stack**:
     - **UI Framework**: Use **Material UI** for consistent design and accessibility.
     - **State Management**: Use **Redux** to handle the application state (e.g., user sessions, calendar events).
     - **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app is mobile-friendly to allow easy access across devices.
     - **Testing**: Use **Jest** and **Cypress** to test UI components and ensure smooth user interactions.

#### 3.3 Database Setup
- **Objective**: Set up and manage the database structure for your FamilyAppâ€™s data storage needs.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Design and implement the **Users Table** to track family member data (e.g., name, email, profile picture).
  2. Create a **Families Table** to store family groups, ownership, and relationships.
  3. **SQL Server**: Use PostgreSQL to manage relational data like user details, family groups, and expense records.
  4. **Media Storage**: Use **Azure Blob Storage** to handle unstructured media files (photos, videos).

#### 3.4 DevOps Setup
- **Objective**: Ensure smooth deployment, scalability, and automation of FamilyApp using DevOps practices.
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Containerization**: Containerize backend services using **Docker** for portability and consistency across environments.
  2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up **GitHub Actions** or **Azure Pipelines** to automate the testing, building, and deployment process for backend and frontend.
  3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use **Terraform** to provision and manage cloud infrastructure (e.g., VMs, Kubernetes clusters).
  4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to track application health and performance.

### Deliverables:
- **Fully Functional MVP**: The FamilyApp should support user registration, group management, basic budgeting, event scheduling, and messaging.
- **API Documentation**: Generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all backend endpoints for easy consumption by the frontend and future developers.
- **Deployment-Ready Codebase**: Ensure the entire codebase is clean, tested, and ready for deployment.
